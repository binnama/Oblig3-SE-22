# Oblig3-SE-22

Followed the teachers guid on how to get maven-surefire to work. Had to add a groupId on top to remove the error that occurred.

After allowing GitHub to help me make the workflow-folder and maven.yml-file followed a lot of googling while trying to understand whay it did not show the test when I ran the job. I did need the TA to tell me that I needed to put Test* in front of all my tests and .class-file to get it worling. After that, Actions woked like a clock. Even though it now runs the tests in both 'Run test' and 'Build with Maven'
